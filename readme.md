Get Lost 
Get Lost is an app created using google maps javascript api v3. It is a tool to aquire randomized maps and directions to generated gps coordinates with currently the app uses math.random and html5 geolocation to create a random route. In future versions I hope to expand on this in a way that takes into account previous routes the user searched for, interesting places along the route and location tracking to allow for more interaction when the user is traveling along the route.
